    Hey fellow tech aficionados! 🚀 I'm Subhadeep Roy, navigating my way through the second year of Computer Science at Techno Main Salt Lake. Brace yourself as I dive deep into the mesmerizing world of web development, donning the hat of both frontend and backend sorcery. 🎩✨

  <p>
    On the frontend battlefield, I wield a formidable arsenal comprising React, React-Vite, GSAP, HTML, and CSS. Crafting seamless user interfaces that captivate and engage is not just a skill but a passion. 🎨 Meanwhile, in the backend domain, I've chosen the path of Node.js and MongoDB, specializing in the MERN stack. The art of seamlessly integrating frontend finesse with backend robustness is where I thrive. 💻🛠️

  <p>
    My journey extends beyond the visible aesthetics of websites; I'm currently immersed in the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, sharpening my skills with the versatile language that is C++. It's not just about creating visually appealing websites but also about architecting them with the solidity that ensures performance and reliability. 🔍💡
  </p>

  <p>
    With a repertoire of projects showcasing both form and function, I bring experience and a thirst for knowledge to the table. Having conquered over 300 LeetCode problems, I relish the challenges of problem-solving and the intellectual stimulation it provides. 🧠💪
